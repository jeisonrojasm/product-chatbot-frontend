Once you have the `.env` file, place it in the root of the project.

### 2. Setting up the development environment with Docker

Due this application is fully Dockerized, you don't need to manually install Node.js or any dependencies on your computer. Simply run the following command from the project root to build the image and launch the frontend container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This command will perform the following actions:

- It will build the Docker image defined in the `Dockerfile`, using `node:24-alpine` as a base.
- It will automatically install all dependencies declared in `package.json`.

Once the process is complete, the frontend will be available at:

```arduino
http://localhost:5173
```

## ‚úÖ Ready-to-use application

Once the previous steps are completed:

- The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.
- You will be able to use the UI to make petitions to backend app.
